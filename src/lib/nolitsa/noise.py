"""Functions for noise reduction.

This module provides two functions for reducing noise in a time series.

  * sma -- returns the simple moving average of a time series.
  * nored -- simple noise reduction algorithm to suppress noise in
    deterministic time series.

    Computes the simple moving average (SMA) of a given time series.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array
        1-D real input array of length N containing the time series.
    hwin : int, optional (default = 5)
        Half-window length.  Actual window size is 2*hwin + 1.

    Returns
    -------
    y : array
        Averaged array of length N - 2*hwin

    Notes
    -----
    An SMA is a linear filter and is known to distort nonlinear
    structures in the time series considerably.

    """Simple noise reduction based on local phase space averaging.

    Simple noise reduction scheme based on local phase space averaging
    (Schreiber 1993; Kantz & Schreiber 2004).

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array
        1-D real input array containing the time series.
    dim : int, optional (default = 1)
        Embedding dimension.
    tau : int, optional (default = 1)
        Time delay.
    r : float, optional (default = 0)
        Radius of neighborhood (see Notes).
    metric : string, optional (default = 'chebyshev')
        Metric to use for distance computation.  Must be one of
        "cityblock" (aka the Manhattan metric), "chebyshev" (aka the
        maximum norm metric), or "euclidean".
    repeat: int, optional (default = 1)
        Number of iterations.

    Return
    ------
    y : array
        1-D real output array containing the time series after noise
        reduction.

    Notes
    -----
    Choosing the right neighborhood radius is crucial for proper noise
    reduction.  A large radius will result in too much filtering.  By
    default, a radius of zero is used, which means that no noise
    reduction is done.  Note that the radius also depends on the metric
    used for distance computation.  Best results are often obtained
    using large embedding dimensions with a unit delay and the Chebyshev
    metric.  (This function is a featureful equivalent of the TISEAN
    program "lazy".)
